/**
 * Provides settings for biometric prompts.
 *
 * @param title Set the title to display.
 * @param subtitle Set the subtitle to display.
 * @param description Set the description to display.
 * @param negativeButtonTextÂ Set the text for the negative button. This would typically be used as
 *    a "Cancel" button, but may be also used to show an alternative method for authentication,
 *    such as screen that asks for a backup password.
 * @param confirmRequired Only applies to Q and above. A hint to the system to require user
 *    confirmation after a biometric has been authenticated. For example, implicit modalities like
 *    Face and Iris authentication are passive, meaning they don't require an explicit user action
 *    to complete. When set to 'false', the user action (e.g. pressing a button) will not be
 *    required. BiometricPrompt will require confirmation by default.
 * @param deviceCredentialsAllowed The user will first be prompted to authenticate with biometrics,
 *    but also given the option to authenticate with their device PIN, pattern, or password.
 *    Developers should first check [android.app.KeyguardManager.isDeviceSecure()] before enabling.
 * @param validityDurationSeconds Sets the duration of time (seconds) for which this key is
 *    authorized to be used after the user is successfully authenticated. This has effect if the
 *    key requires user authentication for its use. By default, if user authentication is required,
 *    it must take place for every use of the key.
